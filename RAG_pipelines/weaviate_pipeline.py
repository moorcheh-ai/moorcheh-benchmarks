# Build your own RAG pipeline! 
# This guide walks you through creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Weviate.

#--- Installation ---
# First, make sure you have these essential libraries installed.
# You can run this command in your terminal:
# pip install openai weaviate-client langchain_community pypdf pandas google-generativeai

#--- Import Libraries ---

    context = retrieve_context(query)
    prompt = f"""Answer the two following questions based on the retrieved passages provided from each query.

1. Relevance Evaluation  
Does the retrieved context directly pertain to the topic and scope of the query?

Provide a relevance score between 0 and 100, where:
100 = The context is entirely focused on the queryâ€™s subject  
50 = The context is partially related (e.g., correct company but wrong financial quarter)  
0 = The context is topically unrelated to the query

Rationale:  
Briefly explain what aspects of the context are topically aligned with the query. If the context includes off-topic information, describe it.

2. Completeness Evaluation  
If someone were to answer the query using only this context, how complete and sufficient would their answer be?

Provide a completeness score between 0 and 100, where:
100 = The context includes all necessary information to fully answer the query  
50 = The context includes some, but not all, key information  
0 = The context includes none of the necessary information

Rationale:  
Clearly state whether the context contains the required facts, figures, or explanations needed to construct a complete answer. If any crucial components are missing, specify what they are.

Context:
{chr(10).join(context)}

Question: {query}
